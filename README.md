### Tools for Spatial Biodiversity Analysis from GDM Rasters Outputs

The `gdmtools` R package is designed to enhance spatial biodiversity analysis by leveraging outputs from Generalized Dissimilarity Modelling (GDM). Built with high-performance code and parallel processing to efficiently handle large raster grids. The package aims to cover methods introduced in Mokany et al. (2022).

Note: `gdmtools` is actively under development, so the user interface and function behavior may change.

### Currently implemented methods:
- Protected area representativeness - predicted similarity to protected areas



## Installation

The [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) toolchain is required to install/build the package on Windows, see the following link for downloading and installing Rtools.
